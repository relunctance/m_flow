## What is M-flow?

The fundamental shift is this: **existing systems build graphs but still retrieve by embedding distance. M-flow makes the graph the retrieval mechanism itself.**

RAG embeds chunks and ranks by vector similarity. GraphRAG goes further — it extracts entities, builds a knowledge graph, and generates community summaries. But when a query arrives, retrieval still reduces to embedding the query and matching against stored text. The graph informs what gets embedded; it does not participate in how results are scored. The retrieval step remains **similarity-driven**.

M-flow takes a different approach: the graph is the scoring engine. When a query arrives, vector search casts a wide net across multiple granularities to find entry points. Then **the graph takes over** — propagating evidence along typed, semantically weighted edges, and scoring each knowledge unit by the tightest chain of reasoning that connects it to the query.

Similar and relevant sometimes overlap, but they are fundamentally different. Consider the query **"Why did the migration fail?"**

**Traditional retrieval** — matches by surface similarity:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q["Query: Why did the\nmigration fail?"] -->|"embed → cosine similarity"| C1["Chunk: Database migration\nbest practices checklist"]
    C1 -->|"✗ wrong answer"| R["keywords match,\nbut answers a\ndifferent question"]
```

**M-flow retrieval** — traces through the knowledge graph:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q["Query: Why did the\nmigration fail?"] -->|search| FP["FacetPoint\nconnection pool\nexhausted at 2:47 AM"]
    FP -->|"edge:pool failure caused\nservice downtime"| F["Facet\nRedis failure\nanalysis"]
    F -->|"edge:core incident\ndetails"| E["Episode\nProduction outage\nFeb 12"]
    E -->|"✓ correct result"| R["Redis connection pool\nexhausted under peak load"]
```

> Zero keyword overlap with "migration" — found through graph path, not text similarity.

The graph finds the answer not by matching words, but by following the chain of evidence. This difference — **from distance-based ranking to path-based reasoning** — is what drives M-flow's consistent advantage across benchmarks.

**M-flow operates like a cognitive system: it captures signal at the sharpest point of detail, traces associations through structured memory, and arrives at the right answer the way human recall does.**

## How It Works

M-flow organizes knowledge into a four-level **Cone Graph** — a layered hierarchy from abstract summaries to atomic facts:

| Level | What it captures | Query example |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Episode** | A bounded semantic focus — an incident, decision process, or workflow | *"What happened with the tech stack decision?"* |
| **Facet** | One dimension of that Episode — a topical cross-section | *"What were the performance targets?"* |
| **FacetPoint** | An atomic assertion or fact derived from a Facet | *"Was the P99 target under 500ms?"* |
| **Entity** | A named thing — person, tool, metric — linked across all Episodes | *"Tell me about GPT-4o"* → surfaces all related contexts |

Retrieval is **graph-routed**: the system casts a wide net across all levels, projects hits into the knowledge graph, propagates cost along every possible path, and scores each Episode by its **tightest chain of evidence**. One strong path is enough — the way a single association triggers an entire memory.

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowElement-ai/m_flow.git && cd m_flow
./quickstart.sh
```

The script checks your environment, configures API keys interactively, and starts the full stack (backend + frontend). On Windows, use `.\quickstart.ps1`.

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install mflow-ai         # or: uv pip install mflow-ai
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowElement-ai/m_flow.git && cd m_flow
pip install -e .             # editable install for development
```

### Run

```python
import asyncio
import m_flow


async def main():
    await m_flow.add("M-flow builds persistent memory for AI agents.")
    await m_flow.memorize()

    results = await m_flow.search("How does M-flow work?")
    for r in results:
        print(r)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### CLI

```bash
mflow add "M-flow builds persistent memory for AI agents."
mflow memorize
mflow search "How does M-flow work?"
mflow -ui          # Launch the local web console
```

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up                       # Backend only
docker compose --profile ui up          # Backend + frontend
docker compose --profile neo4j up       # Backend + Neo4j
docker compose --profile postgres up    # Backend + PostgreSQL + PGVector
```

### Playground with Face Recognition

The Playground provides interactive multi-person conversations with face-aware memory.
It requires [fanjing-face-recognition](https://github.com/FlowElement-ai/fanjing-face-recognition) as a companion service.

**Quick setup** (clones repo, downloads models, configures `.env`):

```bash
./scripts/setup-playground.sh
```

The script detects your OS and prints the exact launch commands when done.

> **Camera access:** Face recognition requires a camera. On macOS/Windows, Docker cannot
> access USB cameras — run fanjing-face-recognition directly on the host (see "Recommended
> setup" below). The `--profile playground` Docker service is only for Linux hosts with
> `/dev/video0` access.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup</strong> (if you prefer step-by-step)</summary>

```bash
# 1. Clone fanjing-face-recognition next to m_flow
git clone https://github.com/FlowElement-ai/fanjing-face-recognition.git ../fanjing-face-recognition

# 2. Download face models
cd ../fanjing-face-recognition
python scripts/download_model.py        # det_10g.onnx  (detection)
python scripts/download_arcface.py      # w600k_r50.onnx (embedding)
python scripts/download_silero_vad.py    # silero_vad_half.onnx (voice activity detection)
curl -L -o models/face_landmarker.task \
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task"

# 3. Prepare .env (if not done already)
cd ../m_flow
cp .env.template .env                   # then edit .env: set LLM_API_KEY, etc.
python -c "import secrets; print('FACE_API_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))" >> .env
```

**Recommended setup (macOS/Windows) — fanjing on host + M-flow in Docker:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: face recognition (on host — has camera access)
cd fanjing-face-recognition
export FACE_API_KEY="<same key from .env>"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_web_v2.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001 --no-browser

# Terminal 2: M-flow backend + frontend (in Docker)
cd m_flow
docker compose --profile ui up --build -d
```

**Linux-only — everything in Docker:**

```bash
docker compose --profile ui --profile playground up --build -d
```

**Fully local (no Docker):**

```bash
# Terminal 1: face recognition
cd fanjing-face-recognition
export FACE_API_KEY="<same key>"
python run_web_v2.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001 --no-browser

# Terminal 2: M-flow backend
cd m_flow
export FACE_API_KEY="<same key>"
python -m uvicorn m_flow.api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The Playground UI is available at `http://localhost:3000` → Playground tab.
The face recognition service runs at `http://localhost:5001`.

> **Note:** When M-flow runs inside Docker and fanjing runs on the host,
> the backend automatically translates `localhost` → `host.docker.internal`.
> No manual URL configuration is needed.

</details>

### MCP Server

```bash
cd m_flow-mcp
uv sync --dev --all-extras
uv run python src/server.py --transport sse
```

## Testing

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest m_flow/tests/unit/ -v        # ~963 test cases
PYTHONPATH=. pytest m_flow/tests/integration/ -v  # Needs .env with API keys
```
